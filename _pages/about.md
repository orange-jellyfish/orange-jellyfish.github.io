We are a group in the School of [School of Computer Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science), [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk) led by [Dr Ognjen ArandjeloviÄ‡](https://oa7.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk).
Our primary research focus areas are machine learning and computer vision, but the full breadth of the group's contributions is far wider, ranging from physiology and sports science, to philosophy and public policy.
Do make sure to check out our publications and the members' pages!
